# CryptoCurrency Rate page issue

## Wait 10s for data
If no data appears on the CryptoCurrency Rate page, please wait 10 seconds, sometimes the API call will take longer.

## No data come up
If the CryptoCurrency Rate page still does not show any data, please try to run the "SmartWallet Final ver 2.zip".
Because the URL provided by the API sometimes not on sever, so the version 2 is another API URL.

## Drop down return
After successfully adding virtual currency to the form, the return method is to drop down the screen
